For this first week we got the environment set up for our application and familiarized ourselves with the project.
Environment setup included installing rbenv/RVM, npm, ruby, rails, and git. 
Issues encountered include using RVM to install ruby, and using the correct version of ruby.
Daniel (using WSL) faced errors with installing ruby via RVM and had to use rbenv instead, which required additional environment setup.
Another issue we had was dealing with github authentication errors for push and commit to a repo from the CLI.
We also took the time to set up and get used to a shared git repository and were able to take a look at the project "website".
